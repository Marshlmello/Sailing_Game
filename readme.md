## Description

School 4.0 Sailing Application is a web-based interactive game that provides students with a simple and interesting learning experience about sailing.

The center of the application is a simplified sailboat that can be controlled with 2 parameters: The sail and the rudder. Both of them have an impact on the position and speed of the boat. Students can experiment and find out how to work with the wind and complete different sailing maneuvers through trial and error. Gamification of the subject piques students' interest in a way that theoretical approaches could not.

The product was developed through a user-focused design process to ensure that it meets the needs of both students and teachers. Since it is a web application, it can be used on different devices; at school and at home. This creates a flexible learning environment and teachers can easily incorporate the product into their everyday teaching.

Hopefully, this app will inspire teachers to use more hands-on learning approaches so that students learn by doing.
